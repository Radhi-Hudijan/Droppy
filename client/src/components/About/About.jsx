            Frustrated by the manual process of using call centres to book
            delivery vehicles and the lack of transparency in pricing and
            availability, a group of problem solvers got together to create
            their own digital solution.
            <br />
            <br />
            Droppy was born to make on-demand delivery possible for everyone at
            the touch of a button. Through a single app, users can gain access
            to a wide fleet of suitable delivery vehicles helmed by professional
            drivers.
            <br />
            <br />
            Simply input the pick up and drop off locations, choose the vehicle
            type that you need and get matched with a nearby driver whoâ€™s ready
            to take the order.
            <br />
            <br />
